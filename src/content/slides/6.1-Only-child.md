title: Only child
notes: |
  There won't always necessarily be both of the old & new pseudo-elements.
  If there's no view transition with a matching name in either capture then the respective capture won't have a pseudo element.

```css
/* [!code word:new] */
/* [!code word:old] */
/* [!code word:\:only-child] */
/* Entering */
::view-transition-new(…):only-child {}
/* Exiting */
::view-transition-old(…):only-child {}
```
