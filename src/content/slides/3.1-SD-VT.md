title: '_Same_-document view transitions'
notes: |
  - Same-document view transitions.
  - These are often referred to as SPA view transitions but that's a misnomer.
  - Just because they're activated with JavaScript doesn't mean they're only for SPAs.
  - They can be used on any web page, regardless of if it's an SPA.

**Can be used on any web page**, regardless of if it's an SPA.

```js
// [!code word:.startViewTransition()]
document.startViewTransition();
```
