title: Same video
notes: |
  Don't want to show the old video, which is frozen.
  Don't want to fade in the new video, especially if we're not showing the old view.
  Add a low quality placeholder background image, if you don't want a flash of the page's background colour.

```css
::view-transition-old(video) {
	display: none;
}

::view-transition-new(video) {
	animation: none;
}

video {
	background-image: url('/Placeholder.webp');
	background-position: center;
	background-size: contain;
}
```
