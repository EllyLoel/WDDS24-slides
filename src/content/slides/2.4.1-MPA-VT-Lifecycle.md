title: '[The lifecycle of a _cross_-document view transition](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-view-transitions-2/#lifecycle)'

<div style="text-align: left">

A successful cross-document view transition goes through the following phases:

<br>
<details style="inline-size: fit-content">
<summary>In the old document:</summary>

1. The user initiates a navigation.
1. When the new page is ready the `pageswap` event is fired.
   - You can now customize the transition, e.g. by mutating its `types`, or `skip` it altogether.
1. Current state captured as the “old” state.
1. Rendering paused.
1. The navigation proceeds.

</details>
<br>
<details style="inline-size: fit-content">
<summary>Then, in the new document:</summary>

1. The `pagereveal` event is fired.
   - This is another opportunity for you to customise the transition, e.g. by mutating its `types`, or `skip` it altogether.
1. Current state captured as the “new” state.
1. Transition pseudo-elements created.
1. Rendering unpaused, revealing the transition pseudo-elements.
1. `viewTransition.ready` fulfils.
1. Pseudo-elements animate until finished.
1. Transition pseudo-elements removed.
1. `viewTransition.finished` fulfils.

</details>
