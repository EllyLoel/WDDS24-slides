title: Old & new block size
---

I've been using this on these slides:

```css
::view-transition-old(*),
::view-transition-new(*) {
	block-size: 100%;
}
```

If the old and new block sizes are similar it looks really great, so much better than without it.
But, if the block sizes aren't similar then it looks not so great.
