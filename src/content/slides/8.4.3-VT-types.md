title: View transition types
notes: It's a pseudo-class not a pseudo-element, don't forget that like I did and then spend far too long scratching your head about why it's not working.

## Hardcoded types

```css
@view-transition {
	navigation: auto;
	types: your-amazing-type; /* [!code ++] */
}
```

## Injected types

```js
// [!code word:'pageswap']
// [!code word:'pagereveal']
window.addEventListener('pageswap', (event) => { // also works on 'pagereveal'
	if (!event.viewTransition) return;
	event.viewTransition.types.add('your-amazing-type'); // [!code ++]
});
```
