title: '`::view-transition-image-pair(*)`'
visuallyHiddenTitle: true

  - Because of styles on the image-pair pseudo-element you can essentially treat the old and new pseudo-elements as direct children of the group pseudo-element for most purposes.

```css
:root::view-transition-image-pair(*) {
	position: absolute;
	inset: 0;

	animation-duration: inherit;
	animation-fill-mode: inherit;
	animation-delay: inherit;
}
```
