title: '`pageswap` & `pagereveal` events'
---

- The `pageswap` event fires before the last frame of a page is rendered. You can use this to do some last-minute changes on the outgoing page, right before the old snapshots get taken.
- The `pagereveal` event fires on a page after it has been initialised or reactivated but before the first rendering opportunity. With it, you can customise the new page before the new snapshots get taken.
