title: Browser support _doesn't matter_
notes: |
  - In Chrome for over one and a half years, coming up on 2 years.
  - Currently being worked on by the Firefox team.
  - In Safari for a bit over 2 months.

It's the poster child of progressive enhancement. You lose **zero** functionality if view transitions aren't supported.

```js
document.startViewTransition
	? document.startViewTransition(() => updateCallback())
	: updateCallback();
```
