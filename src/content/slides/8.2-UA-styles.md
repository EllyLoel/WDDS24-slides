title: User-agent view transition styles
notes: |
  This UA style sheet does several things:
  - Give the root element a default view transition name, to allow it to be independently selected.
  - Lay out `::view-transition` to cover the entire snapshot containing block so that each `::view-transition-group()` child can lay out relative to it.
  - Reduce layout interference from the `::view-transition-image-pair()` pseudo-element so that authors can essentially treat `::view-transition-old()` and `::view-transition-new()` as direct children of `::view-transition-group()` for most purposes.
  - Inherit animation timing through the tree so that by default, the animation timing set on a `::view-transition-group()` will dictate the animation timing of all its descendants.
  - Style the element captures `::view-transition-old()` and `::view-transition-new()` to match the size and position set on `::view-transition-group()` (insofar as possible without breaking their aspect ratios) as it interpolates between them. Since the sizing of these elements depends on the mapping between logical and physical coordinates, dynamic view transition style sheet copies relevant styles from the DOM elements.
  - Set up a default quarter-second cross-fade animation for each `::view-transition-group()`.
