1. In the old document:
   1. The user initiates a navigation.
   1. When the new page is ready the `pageswap` event is fired.
      - You can now customise the transition, e.g. by mutating its `types`, or `skip` it altogether.
   1. Current state captured as the “old” state.
   1. Rendering paused.
   1. The navigation proceeds.
1. Then, in the new document:
   1. The `pagereveal` event is fired.
      - This is another opportunity for you to customise the transition.
   1. Current state captured as the “new” state.
   1. Transition pseudo-elements created.
   1. Rendering unpaused, revealing the transition pseudo-elements.
   1. <code>viewTransition<wbr>.ready</code> fulfils.
   1. Pseudo-elements animate until finished.
   1. Transition pseudo-elements removed.
   1. <code>viewTransition<wbr>.finished</code> fulfils.
