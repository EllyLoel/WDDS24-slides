title: Identical images with different aspect ratios
notes: Same as the last one except we're setting the height to be the same as the group, and then clipping any overflow. That way when we set object fit contain and cover on the old and new respectively we don't get any unwanted overflowing.

```css
::view-transition-old(identical-image),
::view-transition-new(identical-image) {
	animation: none;
	mix-blend-mode: normal;
	block-size: 100%;
	overflow: clip;
}

::view-transition-old(identical-image) {
	object-fit: contain;
}

::view-transition-new(image) {
	object-fit: cover;
}
```
