title: No dependencies
notes: |
  Historically, implementing animations required libraries like GSAP or ~~Framer~~ Motion. The View Transitions API removes the need for any dependencies, reducing project complexity and load times while aligning with modern web standards. It’s easy to implement and doesn’t balloon your project’s bundle size. Developers can focus on implementing the animations instead of dealing with dependency conflicts.
