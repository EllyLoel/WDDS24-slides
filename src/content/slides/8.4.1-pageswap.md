	// [!code word:from]
	// [!code word:Current page URL]
	event.activation.entry.url; // Where you're going

	event.activation.from.url; // Current page URL

	event.activation.type; // 'push' | 'replace' | 'reload' | 'traverse'

	event.viewTransition.skipTransition(); // Skip the view transition.

	await event.viewTransition.ready; // The animations are about to start.

	await event.viewTransition.finished; // The animations are finished.
});
