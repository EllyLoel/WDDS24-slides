title: People love and hate animations
notes: |
  - Without animations, websites can feel robotic and glitchy.
  - When overdone, they can frustrate or hurt users. (Too long, too much motion, distracting, etc.)
  - When thoughtfully implemented, animations make interactions, and thus the website, feel grounded in reality.
  - Like the website is a natural extension of the physical world into the digital.
