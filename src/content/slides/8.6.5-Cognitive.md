  On a basic level, animating an element’s movement makes its path visible on screen. Your user doesn’t have to keep track of the movement in their head. Instead, that effort is essentially off-loaded from their brain to the animation you created on screen. When you reduce cognitive load, you free up users’ working memory resources to focus on other things—like learning new skills and retaining information.
  Beyond the cognitive load benefits, other studies show that animation can improve decision-making and even help people learn and remember spatial relationships. Animating between states can also help prevent change blindness.
